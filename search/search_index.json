The technology will greatly increase annotation effectivity, will help to reduce reaction time to urgent situations, e.g. the occurrence of a conflict species in new areas or a harmed animal, will help to improve and simplify the identification of the individuals and to refine population estimates of endangered species, and will help to find new relations in the indexed data across time and diverse locations. The developed methods and tools will improve the monitoring of invasive species. The technologies will streamline activities of public administration, namely AOPK \u010cR responsible for reporting species status according to Art. 17 of Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC).</p>"},{"location":"#the-application","title":"The application","text":"<p>Application can be found at: https://caid.kky.zcu.cz/.</p>"},{"location":"#the-project-web-presentation","title":"The project web presentation","text":"<p>More information about project can be found on the web presentation of the project.</p>"},{"location":"#funding","title":"Funding","text":"<p>The project is funded by the Technology Agency of the Czech Republic (TA\u010cR) under the project number SS05010008-V9.</p>"},{"location":"#workflows","title":"Workflows","text":"<p>workflows</p>"},{"location":"#welcome-to-mkdocs","title":"Welcome to MkDocs","text":"<p>For full documentation visit mkdocs.org.</p>"},{"location":"#commands","title":"Commands","text":"<ul> <li><code>mkdocs new [dir-name]</code> - Create a new project.</li> <li><code>mkdocs serve</code> - Start the live-reloading docs server.</li> <li><code>mkdocs build</code> - Build the documentation site.</li> <li><code>mkdocs -h</code> - Print help message and exit.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#project-layout","title":"Project layout","text":"<pre><code>mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.\ndocs/\n    index.md  # The documentation homepage.\n    ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"workflows/","title":"User documentation","text":"<p>The application is created to help categorize images according to the species and identify animals in camera trap images.

The main view gives you the access to most important functions.</p> <p>Users typically collect data by retrieving image data from a camera trap after a certain period of time.  The first step is then to sort the images by animal species.  As input for automatic species recognition, we expect a ZIP archive containing data from a single camera trap.  The user only needs to confirm or provide the camera trap location.  The classification of animal species in the images is carried out automatically.  The output is a ZIP archive containing the input data organized into folders by species and a CSV file with metadata (such as date/time the image was taken, identified species, etc.).</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"workflows/#data-upload","title":"Data upload","text":"<p>The user can upload a ZIP archive containing images from a camera trap.
