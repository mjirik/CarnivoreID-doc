The technology will greatly increase annotation effectivity, will help to reduce reaction time to urgent situations, e.g. the occurrence of a conflict species in new areas or a harmed animal, will help to improve and simplify the identification of the individuals and to refine population estimates of endangered species, and will help to find new relations in the indexed data across time and diverse locations. The developed methods and tools will improve the monitoring of invasive species. The technologies will streamline activities of public administration, namely AOPK \u010cR responsible for reporting species status according to Art. 17 of Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC).</p> <p>More information about project can be found on the web presentation of the project.</p>"},{"location":"#funding","title":"Funding","text":"<p>The project is funded by the Technology Agency of the Czech Republic (TA\u010cR) under the project number SS05010008-V9.</p>"},{"location":"build_docs/","title":"Building Documentation with MkDocs","text":"<p>Project is built automatically using MkDocs and hosted on GitHub Pages.</p>"},{"location":"build_docs/#project-layout","title":"Project layout","text":"<pre><code>mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.\ndocs/\n    index.md  # The documentation homepage.\n    ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"build_docs/#commands","title":"Commands","text":"<ul> <li><code>pdm install</code> - Install the project dependencies.</li> <li><code>pdm run mkdocs serve</code> - Start the live-reloading docs server.</li> </ul> <p>Other commands you can use:</p> <ul> <li><code>mkdocs build</code> - Build the documentation site.</li> <li><code>mkdocs -h</code> - Print help message and exit.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"cloud_import/","title":"Cloud import","text":""},{"location":"contact/","title":"Contact","text":"<p>The application is developed by the Department of Cybernetics at the University of West Bohemia.

The first step is then to sort the images by animal species.  As input for automatic species recognition, we expect a ZIP archive containing data from a single camera trap.  The user only needs to confirm or provide the camera trap location.  The classification of animal species in the images is carried out automatically.
