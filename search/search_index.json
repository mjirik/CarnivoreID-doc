The technology will greatly increase annotation effectivity, will help to reduce reaction time to urgent situations, e.g. the occurrence of a conflict species in new areas or a harmed animal, will help to improve and simplify the identification of the individuals and to refine population estimates of endangered species, and will help to find new relations in the indexed data across time and diverse locations. The developed methods and tools will improve the monitoring of invasive species.
