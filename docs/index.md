## The Carnivore ID application

The application is created to help categorize images according to the species and identify animals in camera trap images.
The two main usage scenarios are:

* Taxon classification - the user can classify images according to the species
* Individuality re-identification - the user can identify individuals in the images


Application can be found at: [https://caid.kky.zcu.cz/](https://caid.kky.zcu.cz/).

## About the project

The project aims to research and develop new technologies related to a deep understanding of data from camera traps. The technology will greatly increase annotation effectivity, will help to reduce reaction time to urgent situations, e.g. the occurrence of a conflict species in new areas or a harmed animal, will help to improve and simplify the identification of the individuals and to refine population estimates of endangered species, and will help to find new relations in the indexed data across time and diverse locations. The developed methods and tools will improve the monitoring of invasive species. The technologies will streamline activities of public administration, namely AOPK ČR responsible for reporting species status according to Art. 17 of Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC).
