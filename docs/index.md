## The Carnivore ID application

The application is created to help categorize images according to the species and identify animals in camera trap
images.

## What is Carnivore ID application?

The Carnivore ID application is a web-based tool designed to assist researchers
and wildlife enthusiasts in classifying and identifying carnivorous animals captured
in camera trap images. The application leverages advanced machine learning
algorithms to automate the process of species classification and individual
identification, making it easier for users to analyze large datasets of wildlife images.

The two main usage scenarios are:

* Taxon classification - the user can classify images according to the species
* Individuality re-identification - the user can identify individuals in the images

## About the project

The project aims to research and develop new technologies related to a deep understanding of data from camera traps. The
technology will greatly increase annotation effectivity, will help to reduce reaction time to urgent situations, e.g.
the occurrence of a conflict species in new areas or a harmed animal, will help to improve and simplify the
identification of the individuals and to refine population estimates of endangered species, and will help to find new
relations in the indexed data across time and diverse locations. The developed methods and tools will improve the
monitoring of invasive species. The technologies will streamline activities of public administration, namely AOPK ČR
responsible for reporting species status according to Art. 17 of Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC).


## Funding

The project is funded by the Technology Agency of the Czech Republic (TAČR) under the project
number [SS05010008-V9](https://starfos.tacr.cz/en/projekty/SS05010008).
